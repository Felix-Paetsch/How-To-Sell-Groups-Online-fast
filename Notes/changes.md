make clear where each kind of validation step happens (probably between parser and construction?)
move test files out of folder,
move line counter?

Do next:
Descript how the link structure (and dependency structure) should work

Have list (or all std_tags) specified like the othrs: include the docs for that at the right place.
Filebuilder specs
Create tags
Create code to also copy and paste currect files and such
Config file
Clean up
Correct tag parsing (Tag::Child)
Varify inputs are correct (e.g. in templates)
templates/general how are the attributes passed to the ejs?

Allow build -> input any type of folder structure
Build -> take in config
Allow "hot" reload (e.g. w/o restarting server)

Specify Server/views/articles/articles.json
Specify File_Builder

Correct file paths
